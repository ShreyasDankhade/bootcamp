1. MkDocs Setup
   - Task: Install MkDocs and Material. Set up a project with docs/ and mkdocs.yml.
   - Exit Criteria: mkdocs serve starts a live preview; it renders at least 3 pages.
2. Add Diagrams and Structure¶
   - Task: Add Mermaid diagrams, navigation, and a landing page.
   - Exit Criteria: Pages are linked in nav, diagrams render, search works.

## Project Overview

This project uses **MkDocs** to generate a static website for project documentation. It is configured with the **Material theme**, which provides a polished, responsive, and user-friendly design. The documentation is written in Markdown and converted into static HTML.

### Features:
- **Page Navigations**: You can navigate through the page
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Integrate **Mermaid diagrams** to visualize data flows, processes, and architecture.
- **Searchable Documentation**: Built-in search functionality for quick content access.
  
## Setup Instructions

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install MkDocs**:
   - Install MkDocs and the Material theme using pip:
     ```bash
     uv pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
     ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**:
   - It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies:
      ```bash
      uv venv
      source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
      ```

3. **Install Project Dependencies**:
   - If you have a `requirements.txt` file, run:
      ```bash
      uv pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

## Development Instructions

1. **Run the MkDocs Development Server**:
   To preview the documentation on your local machine, use the following command:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```
   This will start a local server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, where you can view the live preview of your documentation.

2. **Edit Documentation**:
   The documentation files are located in the `docs/` directory. You can add new pages, edit existing ones, and use Markdown syntax for formatting.

3. **Adding Diagrams**:
   You can add **Mermaid diagrams** in your `.md` files like this:
   ```markdown
   ## Example Mermaid Diagram

   ```mermaid
   graph TD;
     A-->B;
     B-->C;
     C-->D;
   ```
   ```
   The `mkdocs-mermaid2` plugin must be installed and configured for diagrams to render correctly.

## Build Instructions

When you're ready to build the static site for deployment, use the following command:
```bash
mkdocs build
```

This will generate the static files in the `site/` directory.

## Deployment

Once you’ve built the project, you can deploy the static site to any static hosting service. Here are some deployment options:

- **GitHub Pages**:
  - Create a `gh-pages` branch and push the contents of the `site/` folder to that branch.
  - Alternatively, you can configure GitHub Pages to use the `main` branch and the `site/` folder for the content.
