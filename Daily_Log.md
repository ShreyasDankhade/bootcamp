# DAILY LOG

## DAY 0 (2nd May)

**Q]** What I Learned

1. I learned about the UV package manager.
   - How **`uv`** works`
   - Common **`uv`** commands
   - Using it to create virtual environments and install Python
2. I also learned about the tool named **ASCIINEMA**
   - How it can capture terminal commands & its output.
3. I learned how the Python module is build & published to the **TestPyPI** repository.
   - How to build a module using **`uv`**.
   - The Packages & Command required to publish to the **TestPyPI** repository.

**Q]** What Confused me

1. I never used the **`uv`** package manager before, so using it with _Pycharm_ & setting _`uv venv`_ as virtual environment was confusing at first.
2. Also, Publishing of the package to _TestPyPI_ was confusing at beginning, but i was able to complete it correctly eventually.
